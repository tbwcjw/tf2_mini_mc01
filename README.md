# Mini Minecraft 2fort Map for Team Fortress 2

A small map for intimate matches and fast pasted action! Blue and Red forts are identical. There are two teleporters in each tunnel and the central stone structure is boobytrapped with TNT... Careful!

My first map. Original map design built in Minecraft and used as a reference in Hammer++ to build the final map.
